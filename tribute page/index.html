      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Rabindranath Tagore, born on May 7, 1861, in Calcutta (now Kolkata), India, was a multifaceted literary genius and Nobel laureate. Coming from a renowned Bengali family, Tagore showed remarkable poetic talents from a young age. His prolific literary career included a vast array of works ranging from poems, short stories, novels, and essays, which often explored themes of love, nature, spirituality, and human emotions. In 1913, he achieved international recognition when he became the first Asian to win the Nobel Prize in Literature for his collection of poems titled "Gitanjali." Beyond his literary achievements, Tagore was a visionary who established Visva-Bharati University, an institution fostering the integration of Indian and Western education and promoting humanistic values. His profound insights into human nature and the universal appeal of his writings have left an indelible mark on the world, making him an enduring icon of Indian culture and literature.
